Name: Fitpal Roead Racer
Description: In broad strokes, the differences between a race road bike and endurance road bike are along the lines of geometry, comfort, clearance, braking and gearing. Race bikes, like the Vantage Comp 1.0 get a bit of a bad wrap as being twitchy, or fast-handling – which is great when you're jostling for position in a race.

Name: FitPal Commuter 1
Description: Bicycle commuting is the use of a bicycle to travel from home to a place of work or study — in contrast to the use of a bicycle for sport, recreation or touring.
Commuting especially lends itself to areas with relatively flat terrain and arrangements to keep riders relatively safe from the hazards of accidents with motorized traffic, e.g. separated bicycle lanes and a general acceptance of cyclists as traffic participants. The rise of the electric bicycle which is quickly surpassing the sales of conventional bicycles will effectively increase bicycle commuting in hilly areas and allow for longer journeys
